# Minimum-Spanning-Tree

Project 2 for my class “CS331 - Design and Analysis of Algorithms” where I had to implement Prim’s algorithm and Kruskal’s algorithm on graphs with n = 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600, 700, 800, 900, 1000 nodes, and for each n value, there was an number of edges e = .2, .4, .6, .8 , 1.0 * max number of edges possible. Both algorithms would be ran and times for each were taken for time analysis.
